# Vertical Cloud Laboratory @ BYU

Autonomous, remote-access, vertically automated labs for materials and manufacturing discovery.

## About
We integrate the concepts of "vertical labs", "cloud labs", and "frugal twins" to make autonomous experimentation more accessible:

- **Vertical labs**: optimize automation-friendly use of vertical space—so equipment comes to the operator (e.g., via a vertical lift module) rather than the operator moving between instruments
- **Cloud labs**: enable remote, decentralized access to experimental resources—democratizing hardware, computation, and domain expertise
- **Frugal twins**: are low-cost, modular physical twins that complement high-cost systems, enabling low-risk prototyping, lower barriers to lab automation, and multi-fidelity optimization

We are a new lab at BYU and welcome early collaborators and contributors.

## Core Research Thrusts
- Autonomous alloy discovery
- Autonomous electrochemistry
- Advanced Bayesian optimization

### Case study: Additively Manufactured Aerospace Alloys

An initial, remotely accessible self-driving lab workflow integrating the following hardware:
- Vertical lift module (automated storage and retrieval)
- Low-cost powder dosing
- Ultrasonic atomizer (human-in-the-loop)
- Small-scale metal 3D printer
- Mechanical testing hardware

Goal: closed-loop alloy discovery and a working example to de-risk transfer of vertical cloud labs to the community.
